Adds a mirrored copy of a sketch or a solid to the shape.

## Properties

Offset
:   Specifies the distance to offset the mirrored copy to the original. Only available if a edge or face of the shape is selected as reference.

Keep Original
:   If checked, the original shape will be included in the result. Otherwise, the result will only contain the mirrored copy.

Merge Faces
:   _Only for solid type bodies._
    If checked, copied faces will be merged to a single face if they are coplanar. Only available with _Keep Original_ being selected.

Reselect Reference
:   Starts reselection of the mirror plane or the edge/face defining the mirror line/plane.

## Remarks
If working with a sketch, the modifier will use a reference edge to define the mirror line. If working with a solid, the modifier will use a reference face to define the mirror plane.

Depending on the shape the direction of the offset may be improper. Invert the offset value to correct this.
