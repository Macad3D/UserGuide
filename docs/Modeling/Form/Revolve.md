## Properties
Axis
:   Defines the axis to revolve around by selection of one of the three base axes of the local or the world coordinate system.

Offset from Axis
:   The distance of the center of revoltion from the selected coordinate system base axis.

Segment
:   If this value is smaller than 360°, a segment of the revolved shape is built using the given angle.

## Remarks
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only closed contours can be revolved. If you want the resulting shape to be solid, close the contour on the axis
          you want to revolve around.
