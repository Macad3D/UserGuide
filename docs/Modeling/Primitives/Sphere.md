## Creating a Sphere

The sphere will be created with the center point on the working plane, so consider setting up the working plane before starting.

1. Select __Create Sphere__ from ribbon menu.
2. Select the center point of the sphere on the working plane.
3. Select any rim point of the sphere. This will define the radius.

> [!NOTE]
>  The pivot point is always set in the center of the sphere.
